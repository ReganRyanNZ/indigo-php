{title: O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me}{comments: Hymns, #255}O Lord, b[G]reathe Thy Sp[C]irit [G]on me,Teach me [D]how to breathe Thee [G]in;Help me pour into Thy [C]bosomAll my l[D]ife of[D7] self and [G]sin.{start_of_chorus}I am b[D]reathing out my [G]sorrow,[C]Breathing out my [D]sin;I am b[G]reathing, breathing, bre[C]athing,[D]All Thy[D7] fulness [G]in.{end_of_chorus}I am breathing out my own life,That I may be filled with Thine;Letting go my strength and weakness,Breathing in Thy life divine.Breathing out my sinful nature,Thou hast borne it all for me;Breathing in Thy cleansing fulness,Finding all my life in Thee.I am breathing out my sorrow,On Thy kind and gentle breast;Breathing in Thy joy and comfort,Breathing in Thy peace and rest.I am breathing out my sickness,Thou hast borne its burden too;I am breathing in Thy healing,Ever promised, ever new.I am breathing out my longingsIn Thy listening, loving ear;I am breathing in Thy answers,Stilling every doubt and fear.I am breathing every moment,Drawing all my life from Thee;Breath by breath I live upon Thee,Lord, Thy Spirit breathe in me.
