{title: Come, Thou Fount of every blessing}{comments: Hymns, #319}Come, Thou F[D]ount of every b[A]lessing,Tune my h[G]eart to si[A7]ng Thy g[D]race;Streams of mercy, never c[A7]easing,Call for s[G]ongs of l[A7]oudest [D]praise.Jesus sought me whe[G]n a s[D]tranger,Wand'ring fro[Bm]m the f[A]ace of G[D]od;He, to save my soul from d[A]anger,Interp[G]osed His pr[A7]ecious b[D]lood.O to grace how great a debtorDaily I'm constrained to be!Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure,Meet for me Thy grace to prove,While I sing the countless treasureOf my God's unchanging love.{start_of_chorus}{end_of_chorus}Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;Prone to leave the God I love:Take my heart, oh, take and seal itWith Thy Spirit from above.Rescued thus from sin and danger,Purchased by the Savior's blood,May I walk on earth a stranger,As a son and heir of God.
