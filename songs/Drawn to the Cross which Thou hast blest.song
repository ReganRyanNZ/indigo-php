{title: Drawn to the Cross which Thou hast blest}{comments: Hymns, #1049}Drawn to[D] the Cross which T[Em]hou hast blest,With he[D]aling gifts for s[G]ouls distrest,T[A]o f[Bm]ind in Thee my L[G]ife, my Rest,Christ cr[A]ucified,[G] I c[D]ome.St[A/C#]ained with[Bm] the sins which I ha[G]ve wroughtIn w[D]ord and deed and se[G]cret thought;F[A]or pa[Bm]rdon which Thy B[G]lood hath bought,Christ cr[A]ucified,[G] I c[D]ome.Weary of selfishness and pride,False pleasures gone, vain hopes denied,Deep in Thy wounds my shame to hide,Christ crucified, I come.Thou knowest all my griefs and fears,Thy grace abused, my misspent years;Yet now to Thee, for cleansing tears,Christ crucified, I come.I would not, if I could, concealThe ills which only Thou canst heal;So to the Cross, where sinners kneel,Christ crucified, I come.Wash me, and take away each stain,Let nothing of my sin remain;For cleansing, though it be through pain,Christ crucified, I come.To share with Thee Thy life divine,Thy very likeness to be mine,Since Thou hast made my nature Thine,Christ crucified, I come.To be what Thou wouldst have me be,Accepted, sanctified in Thee,Through what Thy grace shall work in me, Christ crucified, I come.
