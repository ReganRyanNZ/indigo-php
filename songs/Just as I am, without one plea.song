I come![G] [C] [G]Just as I am, and waiting notTo rid my soul of one dark blot;To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,O Lamb of God, I come, I come!Just as I am, though tossed aboutWith many a conflict, many a doubt;Fightings within, and fears without,O Lamb of God, I come, I come!Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;Sight, riches, healing of the mind;Yes, all I need, in Thee to find,O Lamb of God, I come, I come!Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;Because Thy promise I believe,O Lamb of God, I come, I come!Just as I am, Thy love unknownHas broken every barrier down;Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,O Lamb of God, I come, I come!
