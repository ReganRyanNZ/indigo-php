These things says 
the Holy One, 
the true One, 
the One who has the key of David, 
the One who opens
no one will shut, 
and shuts and no one opens:

{start_of_chorus}
I know your works; 
behold, 
I have put before you an opened door 
which no one can shut, 
because you have 
a little power 
and have kept My word 
and not denied My name.
{end_of_chorus}
