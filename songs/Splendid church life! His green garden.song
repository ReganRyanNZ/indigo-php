{title: Splendid church life! His green garden}{comments: Hymns, #1237}[G]Splendid church life! His green garden!He has [C]brought us, praise the Lord,To ex[D]perience the ChristWho's growing [G]here![D]He is [G]full of rich enjoymentTo His s[C]aints in one accord;He is [D]new and fresh, av[D7]ailable and [G]dear.{start_of_chorus}I'm so [G7]happy [C]in this lovely place,[D]In the garden g[D7]rowing in His g[G]race!There is no finer pleasureThan to e[C]at the living treeAnd to g[D]et the living water into me[G].{end_of_chorus}It is not a school or fact'ryOr a chapel in the air;But a garden where our LordCan plant and sow.So He's placed us all here corporatelyTo be His garden fair,Where He's free to cultivateAnd make us grow.Thus within the church-life gardenThere's a fruit-producing treeFull of life and so available to eat.So be simple, don't be hardened,Drop your concepts—eat that tree!Take in Jesus every moment—He's so sweet!With the tree there is the water,Flowing God in Christ to us,Quenching all our dryness,Ending all our strife.Hallelujah! In His gardenJesus flows Himself to us,As the full supply for us to grow in life.Aren't you satisfied and thankfulThat our Lord has brought you inWhere His pleasures and His richesFlow so free?So be happy and be joyful,In the spirit feast on Him,So God's garden can bear fruit abundantly.
