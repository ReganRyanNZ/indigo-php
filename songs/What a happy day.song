{title: What a happy day}{section: Gospel}{comments: Hymns, #1333}What a ha[G]ppy dayWhen I no more could tu[C]rn away,When Jesus took my [G]heartfrom the black of ni[Em]ghtIn[Am]to the ki[D7]ngdom of His li[G]ght.Now my life’s begun,The “really life” that’s in the Son.No more am I enthralled by earth’s empty dreams;Deep in me flows a living stream.As I turn to HimHe fills me with His life within.His life becomes my life in reality;Oh, hallelujah, He’s in me!I just love You, Lord,With other loves, You break the cord.You’ll be my life for all eternity;You are the only One for me.
