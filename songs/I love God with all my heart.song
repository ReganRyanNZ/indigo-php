{title: I love God with all my heart}{comments: G-Em-C-D (repeat)}I love God with all my heartAnd with all my soul.He is the One I love so much.I love the Lord with all my heartAnd every part of my soul.I love You, Lord Jesus,With all my heart and with all my soul.You are the only One in the universeFor me, dear Lord.I love the Lord and He loves me — this I know.I love the Bible — Oh, how it makes me grow.I love the church life with all the saints I goSinging, praising, calling on the Lord.I love God with all my heartAnd all of my soulAnd all of my strengthAnd I will love Him to the end.Bodom, bodom, bodom, bodom, bodom.
