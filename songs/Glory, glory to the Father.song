[D]Glory, glory to the [Em]Father!
[A]Glory, glory to the [D]Son!
Glory, glory to the [G]Spirit!
[D]Glory to the [A]Three in [D]One!

[D]Let us praise Him! Let us praise Him!
Praise our God, the Three in [Em]One![A]
[D]Give Him glory; give Him glory!
Wondrous things for us our [A7]God hath [D]done.

Praise the Father who has purposed!
Praise the Son who all has done!
Praise the Spirit who transmitteth!
Praise the Three who work as one!
