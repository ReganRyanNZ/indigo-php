{title: Seek ye the Lord all ye people}[C]Seek ye the Lord all ye p[Dm]eople,[F]Turn to Him while He is nea[C]r,[Em]Let the wicked for[Dm]sake his own way,And [F]call on Him while He may [G]hear.[C]Ho, everyone who is th[Dm]irsty,[F]Come to the waters of [C]life,[Em]Come and drink of the [Dm]milk and the wine,[F]Come without money and [C]price.{start_of_chorus}And there is pe[F]ace like a r[G]iver,And gl[C]ory div[Am]ine.If you’ll [Dm]come to the [G]water,If you’ll [C]taste [Em]of His [Am]wine.There is l[F]ove ever f[G]lowing,And j[C]oy ever f[Am]ull,And there’s [Dm]life ever[G]lastingFor us [C]all.[F] [C]{end_of_chorus}For you shall go out in joy,And be led forth in peace.The mountains and hills before you shall sing,And the trees of the fields clap their hands.Instead of the thorns shall come cypress,And myrtle replace every brier,And it shall be to remember the Lord, An everlasting sign.
