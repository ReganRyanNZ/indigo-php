{start_of_chorus}
[G]Eye, [B7]eye, eye, [C]eye!
Our e[D7]yes can see the n[G]ight sky!
{end_of_chorus}

The m[G]oon and the planets are s[D7]o far away,
but G[Am]od sends their l[D7]ight to us [G]each day.

The great constellations we see over here
are different from those you see elsewhere.

The Milky Way galaxy, oh, what a sight!
and comets and meteors shoot by!

I thank You, Lord, for all the heavens we see,
the firmament shows that You love me!
