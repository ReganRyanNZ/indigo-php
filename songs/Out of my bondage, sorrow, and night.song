Jesus, I come!Into Thy blessed will to abide,Jesus I come to Thee!Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,Out of despair into raptures above,Upward for aye on wings like a dove,Jesus, I come to Thee!Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!Into the joy and pleasure, Thine own,Jesus, I come to Thee!Out of the depths of ruin untold,Into the flock Thy love doth enfold,Ever Thy glorious face to behold,Jesus, I come to Thee!
