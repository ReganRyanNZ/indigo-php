{title: When you say Lord}
{comments: Capo 3}

[D]When you say [G]"Lord"
You say a lot of things 
Nobody else can [D]say.
When you say [G]"Lord"
You say you care enough
To only want the [D]King of kings
For there is [C]nothing more,
There's only [D]something less.
Jesus is [C]all in all,
He is the [D]very best.
When you say [G]"Lord [A]Jesus!"
You've said it [D]all.
