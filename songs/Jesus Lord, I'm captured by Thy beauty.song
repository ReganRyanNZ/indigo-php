{title: Jesus Lord, I'm captured by Thy beauty}{section: Experience of Christ}{comments: Hymns, #1159}Jesus [D]Lord, I’m captured by Thy [Em]beauty,All my [A]heart to Thee I open [D]wide;Now set free from all religious [Em]duty,Only [A]let me in Thyself a[D]bide.As I’m gazing here upon Thy [G]glory,Fill my [Em]heart with [A]radiancy di[D]vine;Saturate me, Lord, I now im[G]plore Thee,Mingle [A]now Thy Spirit, Lord, with [D]mine.Shining One – how clear the sky above me!Son of Man, I see Thee on the throne!Holy One, the flames of God consume me,Till my being glows with Thee alone.Lord, when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor,All self-love and glory sank in shame;Now my heart its love and praises render,Tasting all the sweetness of Thy name.Precious Lord, my flask of alabasterGladly now I break in love for Thee;I anoint Thy head, Beloved Master;Lord, behold, I’ve saved the best for Thee.Dearest Lord, I waste myself upon Thee;Loving Thee, I’m deeply satisfied.Love outpoured from hidden depths within me,Costly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.My Beloved, come on spices’ mountain;How I yearn to see Thee face to face.Drink, dear Lord, from my heart’s flowing fountain,Till I rest fore’er in Thine embrace.Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,But with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;Jesus Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied.
