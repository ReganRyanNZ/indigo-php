{title: There is a great myst'ry}[C]There is a great myst’ryA romantic st[Em]ory,For ages it w[F]as veiled,But now fully r[C]evealed[G];‘Tis a romance di[C]vineOf God and man in t[Em]ime;Beyond under[F]standing,Yet seen in God’s spea[G]king.{start_of_chorus}God fell in love w[C]ith man.For only God’s lo[Am]ve canMake man just the [F]same as HeIn life and in [G]nature.We are His expr[C]ession,His bride, His enla[Am]rgement;Forever toge[F]ther,As living, ins[C]ep’rable as one c[G]ouple[G7]Eternal[C]ly.{end_of_chorus}Though He was rejectedBy men who were blinded;His love is constraining,His heart still unchanging;Thus He became a manWith a definite plan;His name is called Jesus,And He came to seek us.Though I have lived in sin,I now have been redeemedBy Christ who died for me,Who was raised in glory.Now I am joined to Him,Together we’re living;I love to enjoy Him,For I’ve been forgiven.His love is so tender,To Him I’ll surrender,His name’s full of savorI gladly call in prayer;His person’s so charming,My heart ever winning;I’ll hold back no longer,I’ll love Him forever.
