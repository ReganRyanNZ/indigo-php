{title: Oh how sweet it is just to know my Christ}Oh how swe[G]et it is just to kn[Em]ow my Christ![C]Knowing Him's the goal of [D]my whole life.Gaining [G]Him supplies me, [Em]day by day,He's r[C]ich, He's excellent in [D]every way.I'm fully c[G]aptured by Him, my [Em]All in All,He fills my h[C]eart with faith to love Him [D]when I call.Every d[G]ay He grows more as [Em]faith in meAs I dw[C]ell one with [D]Him organicall[G]y.As a stream of love, how His life flows in!Motivating us to just love Him.So we give ourselves; Lord, do grow in usMay we know You in Your preciousness.O Lord, do make us one as we run toward You,Pursuing corp'rately in everything we doWith the saints until full maturityAs Your loving counterpart eternally.
