{title: For we do not have}

[D]For we do not have
A [A]high priest who cannot
Be [Bm]touched with the feeling
Of our [G]weaknesses,
[D]But one who has been
[A]Tempted in all respects like [Bm]us
Yet without sin[G]
Yet without sin

[D]Let us 
Therefore come [A]forward
With [Bm]boldness
To the [G]throne of grace
[D]That we
May re[A]ceive mercy and
[Bm]Find grace
For [G]timely [D]help.
