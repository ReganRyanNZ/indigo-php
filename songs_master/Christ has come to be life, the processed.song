Drink! And riverside,Grows the tree,Our enjoyment for eternity!{end_of_chorus}So I’ve no cause to frownas one who’s received this zoe.I know life runs its courseand triumphs inevitably.I’m required just to stay in the flow,If I do the drinkingThen God gives the growth.So there’s joy in my heart,And a spring in my step,And a smile on my face as I sing,Oh, I’ve got rivers of life,Flowing out of my innermost being!I’ve got rivers of life,Flowing out of my innermost being!{comments: (Do not repeat chorus)}
