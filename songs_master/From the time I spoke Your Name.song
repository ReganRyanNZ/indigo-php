{title: From the time I spoke Your Name}From the ti[D]me I s[G]poke Your Na[D]me,Lord, my [G]life's not been the [D]sameSince I called on the only One Who'dsav[A]e me.[A7]When for[D]saken,[G] in de[D]spair --Who'd have [G]thought that You'd be t[D]here?Now I've found out, J[A]esus, You're a[D]live![D7]{start_of_chorus}Now my[G] eyes begin to seeI'm living [D]as I ought to be,As this [G]turning, burning Godmoves in my [A]heart.[A7]I don't [D]care now [G]how I fee[D]l;I just [G]know that this is [D]real,And I know, O [A]Jesus, You're a[D]live!{end_of_chorus}All my friends may think it’s square,Since I’ve touched You I don’t care,For I’ve found You’re the only life worth living.Though some mock and criticise,Lord, they just don’t realiseThat I’ve found out, Jesus, You’re alive!It's no statue that I call,Not a picture on the wall,But a Person Who lives His life within me.Wish they'd told me long before,All You want's an open door,And that really, Jesus, You're alive!
