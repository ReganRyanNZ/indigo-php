{title: We all need to have}[G]We all need to h[D]aveFull faith in our [G]God;His heart, His wi[C]ll,His abili[D]ty.Believe that His w[G]ordThat He has sent for[C]th;Won't return to Him voi[G]d.{start_of_chorus}God's Word is our swo[C]rd.Take it up every mor[D]ning.Exer[C]cise your spi[G]rit,His word to rec[D]eive.Standing in the Bo[C]dyWith the whole armour on;[D]We slay the enemy.[G] [C] [G]{end_of_chorus}First thing when we wake,Satan sends flaming darts:Temptations, questions,Lies and doubts.So, we must be equipped;Pray-reading His Word,Filled with Christ, Reality.Have faith in His WordAnd in His sovereignty.All our mistakesHe has allowed;We're not bound by regret,We're under the blood,Exercising our faith.We are not alone.One of many are we.Holding the HeadOut from WhomYou and I are joined,Growing to His fulness,His plan to fulfil.
