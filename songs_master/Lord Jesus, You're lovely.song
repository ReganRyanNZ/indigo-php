{title: Lord Jesus, You're lovely}[C]Lord Jesus, You're [G]lovely.You're m[F]ore to be desi[C]red,Than a[Am]ny earthly p[Em]leasure.You're f[Dm]ine, beyond compa[G]re.Lord J[C]esus, Your b[G]eautyDoes f[F]ar exceed all ot[C]hers.You're c[Am]omely and You're te[Em]nder.You're r[Dm]adiant[G] and You're[C] fair.When I behold You, Jesus,You draw my heart completely.I cannot turn away, Lord,I rest in Your embrace;And time is gone, there's onlyYour holy, matchless presence,Abiding in You, gazingUpon Your glorious face.I give my life to You, Lord,For You alone are worthy.There's nothing and there's no oneThat I desire but You.May all my days be Yours, Lord,My heart be given to love You,To treasure and to serve YouBy Your sufficient grace.
