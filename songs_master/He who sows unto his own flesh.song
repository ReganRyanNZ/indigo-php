{title: He who sows unto his own flesh}
{comments: Gal. 6:7-9}

[C]He who sows un[F]to his own flesh
Reaps corr[C]uption of the fl[G]esh; (trouble!)
[C]He who sows un[F]to the Spirit
Will re[C]ap ete[Am]rnal li[G]fe.

{start_of_chorus}
[C]Godâ€™s not mo[F]cked,
Do not be dec[G]eived,
For whatever you s[C]ow, you will re[F]ap,
You will re[C]ap what you s[G]ow;
Sow the li[F]fe seed.[C]
{end_of_chorus}

Every choice is planting seeds,
So be careful what you sow; (careful!)
Just as an apple seed,
It will grow an apple tree.
