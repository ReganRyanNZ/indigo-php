{title: Did you know that I'm a God-man}{start_of_chorus}[G]Did you [C]know that I[Am]’m a God-[D]man?A [G]three-part [C]man mingled[Am]with the Triune[C] GodAnd I[G] have a [C]spirit[G]Where the e[C]nemy has no [D]way,no h[C]ope, no gr[D]oundI am a God-man[G].I am a God-man!{end_of_chorus}[G]The Lord lives ins[C]ide of [D]meAnd He's us[G]ing my sp[C]irit as a b[G]eachheadTo sp[C]read Himself into eve[D]ry partof my m[Em]ind, e[C]motion, and w[G]ill[D].[G]He sowed Himself as [C]the seedin[B7]to my innermost pa[Em]rt[C]And the kingdom is her[D]e,tod[C]ay, now inside of me[G].And my he[C]art is n[D]ow His h[G]ome.Every time I say – Amen!To His Spirit and walk by my spirit,The kingdom seed grows and develops deep inside of me.On the outside, it may seem thatthere’s no change in meBut I’m not the same,cause as the seed grows in me,Inside I’m becoming God.
