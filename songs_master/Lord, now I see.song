{title: Lord, now I see}Lord, now I s[D]e[DM7]eYou only w[G]ant me to belie[Em]ve,Not to dw[A]ellOn all my fa[D]ilures a[A]nd def[Bm]eats -To bel[G]ieve what Y[D]ou have done,And no[G]t in w[Em]hat I[A] see.Lord, I believeWhen all around me is defeat,And it seemsThat nothing’s changing outwardly.No, I’m not discouraged -I’m believing You.Yes, I believe,And there is no demand on me.Simple faith -Yes, that is all You want from me.Freed from anxious doubting, Lord,I’m free to just believe.Believing You,Because, Lord, You are my success.When I fail, all I must do is just confessAnd go on enjoying You.{no_number}I[G] love beli[A]eving [D]You!
