We [D]praise Thee, O God,
For the Son of Thy love,
For our Savior who died and
Is [A]now gone [E7]a[A]bove.

{start_of_chorus}
Halle[D]lujah! Thine the glory,
Hallelujah! A[A]men;
Halle[D]lujah! Thine the glory,
We [G]praise Thee [A]ag[D]ain.
{end_of_chorus}

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior,
And scattered our night.

All glory and praise
To Thee, Father of love,
For through Jesusâ€™ redemption
Thy heart we may prove.

We praise Thee again;
We are filled with Thy love,
And each heart is rekindled
With fire from above.
