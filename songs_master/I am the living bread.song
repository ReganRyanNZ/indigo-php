[G]I [C]am the [Em]living [D]bread,
[G]Which [C]came down [Em]out of [D]heaven.
[G]If [C]anyone,
[Em]If [D]anyone [G]eats of this [Em]bread
[C]He shall [D]live for[G]ever.

[Em]And the bread (and the [C]bread)
Which I will (which I [G]will)
give is my [D]flesh.
[Em]Given for (given [C]for)
For the life (for the [G]life)
of the [D]world.
