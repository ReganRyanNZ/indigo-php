[D]Revelation 3:12
He who over[Bm]comes, 
him [G]I will make a [D]pillar 
in the [Bm]temple[G]
of My [D]God, and he [G]shall by [D]no means 
go out anymore, 
and [Em]I will write upon him 
the [Bm]name of My [A]God 
the [Bm]name of the [G]city of My [D]God, 
the [G]New Jerusa[A]lem, 
which [Bm]descends out of [F#m]heaven 
from My [A]God, 
and My new [D]name.
