{title: I come to Thee, dear Lord}{comments: (Hymns, #812)}[D]I come to [G]Thee, dear [D]Lord,My heart doth th[E7]irst for [A]T[]hee;[D]Of Thee I’d [D7]eat, of [G]Thee I’d [Em]drink,En[D]joy Thee [A]thoroughl[D]y.Just to behold Thy face,For this my heart doth cry;I deeply long to drink of TheeMy thirst to satisfy.Thy glorious, radiant faceMy heart delights to see;Here I'd abide and ne'er depart,Beholding constantly.In such a fellowshipThou, Lord, art grace to me;My heart and spirit gladdened, filled,I enter rest in Thee.Lord, I would linger here,Still seeking after Thee,Continue in the Word and prayerTill Thou dost flow thru me.
