[G]Hallelujah![A7]Turning, turning all the [D]way!{end_of_chorus}But our vessels need oil for Thy coming;We must gain a reserve supply.So our vessels we give for the fillingThat our lamps may never, never die.{start_of_chorus}Fill us, Jesus! Fill us, Jesus!Every moment give us more of Thee!Fill us, Jesus! Fill us, Jesus!Fill us with reality!{end_of_chorus}Then we’ll burn till the Lord comes tomeet us,Then we’ll burn till He comes that day.Then we’ll go in with Him to the weddingAnd be brightly burning all the way.{start_of_chorus}Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!Come and find us filled and burning bright!Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!Come and in Thy Bride delight.{end_of_chorus}
