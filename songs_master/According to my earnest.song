{title: According to my earnest}

[G]According to my [C]earnest 
expectation and [D]hope 
that in [G]nothing I will [C]be 
put to [D]shame, 
but with all [G]boldness, as al[D]ways, 
even [C]now Christ will be 
magnified in my [D]body, 
whether through [G]life 
or through [C]death.
Philippians [D]1:[G]20
