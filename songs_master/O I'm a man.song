{title: O I'm a man}{section: Gospel}{comments: Hymns, #1293}O I’m a [G]man—I’m the [Em]meaning of the [C]univ[G]erse;Yes, I’m a man—I’m the [Em]meaning of the [A7]univ[D]erse.God made me [G]such,[G7]I am so [C]much;I’m the [D]center and the meaning of the[D7]univ[G]erse.Christ lives in me—He’s the meaning of my human life;Christ lives in me—He’s the meaning of my human life.Yes, He’s in meMy all to be;He’s the meaning and reality of my human life.The church is Christ—His expression on the earth today;The church is Christ—His expression on the earth today.This corporate manFulfills God’s plan,That this man may have dominion over all the earth.The local church—It’s the new and real family life;The local church—It’s the new and real family life.We have the wayTo live today—Eating, drinking Christ we’re built up as the local church.What shall we do?We should go and tell the world of this.What shall we do?We should go and tell the world of this.Disciple all—This is our call.Let us go and spread the news abroad to every land.
