{title: Some, these days, would tell us that}{comments: Capo 3}[D]Some, these days, would [G]tell us thatOur J[D]esus is not food,[G]That we only [D]need to knowAb[E7]out Him and do goo[A7]d,[D]But we’re glad to [G]tell you brothers,[D]It’s just not that way[G]Jesus is the [D]bread of life;We e[E7]at Him [A7]every [D]day.{start_of_chorus}We love the [D7]church life,[G]Eating, drinking, [D]breathing Jesus.We love the c[Bm]hurch life,[E7]Taking in God’s W[A]ord.[D]We love to [D7]hear those“[G]O Lord, Amen, [D]Hallelujahs!”We love the [Bm]church life,[E7]Feasting [A7]with the [D]Lord.{end_of_chorus}When He fills our inward parts,We’re never quite the sameSo much richness we can tasteBy calling on His name.“Services” but once a weekFor us will never do.Everyday we need the fellowshipTo take us through.If these latter days andSituations of the worldMake you feel that round a viciousCircle you are swirled,Then please listen closelyTo the things we have to say;It may be that you will findWith us a better way.
