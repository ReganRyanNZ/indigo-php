[D]All sinners are the sla[A]ves of sin,
All p[Bm]oisoned b[D]y death’s st[G]ing;
Christ on[D]ly c[Bm]an from s[Em]in and de[A]ath
A f[Bm]ull deli[A7]verance br[D]ing.
He is the Everla[A]sting One,
Who lo[D]ngs to s[D7]et us fr[G]ee;
If w[D]e do n[Bm]ot beli[Em]eve in H[A]im,
We’ll d[Bm]ie in m[A7]isery.[D]
