{title: He stepped out of glory}{comments: Capo 2}[G]He stepped out of gl[C]o[D]r[Em]y,And pu[C]t on the lo[G]w[D]l[Em]y,And li[D]fe’s very A[C]u[D]t[Am]horA c[C]reature beca[D]m[D7]e.Despised and forsak[C]e[D]n[Em],Af[C]flicted with [G]s[D]o[Em]rrow,From in[D]finite sp[C]l[D]e[Am]ndor,To the li[D]keness of sh[G]a[C]m[G]e.He chose to be humbled,He chose limitation,He chose to be finite,He chose to be man.God’s unfathomed purposeFound substance in Jesus!A two-natured being —The unique God-man.His own shell was brokenReleasing His glory,This life impartationProduced many grains.The Firstborn rejoicesWith His many brothers —An incorporationDivine and human!We cannot but love Him!Our lovely Forerunner;His shame was our vict’ry,His anguish our joy.The children of judgmentHe brought into glory,The millions of God-menForever rejoice!
